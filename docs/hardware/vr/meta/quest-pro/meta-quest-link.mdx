# Meta Quest Link/AirLink

Meta Quest Link is Meta's official, first-party PCVR streaming application, supporting a headset connection through USB or Wifi (known as "Meta Quest AirLink"). 
The streamer is built into the Quest operating system and connects to the [Meta Quest Link PC app](https://www.oculus.com/download_app/?id=1582076955407037).

## Setup

<Admonition type="info">
  <p>Developer mode is <i>required</i> if using Meta Quest Link/Airlink! It is not a requirement for any other PCVR method.</p>
</Admonition>

0. If you have never used Meta Quest Link/AirLink before, follow [Meta's official guide](https://www.meta.com/help/quest/1517439565442928/).
1. [**MAKE SURE YOUR HEADSET HAS EYE AND FACE TRACKING ENABLED**](#enabling-eye-and-face-tracking-on-the-headset)
2. **CREATE DEVELOPER ACCOUNT AND ENABLE DEVELOPER MODE**: 

    1. [Set up a Meta Quest developer account](https://developer.oculus.com/sign-up/)
        * A developer account is still ***necessary*** as the eye and face over Meta Quest Link toggles are currently still in the developer settings of the Meta Quest Link PC application.
      It is rather trivial to apply for and there is no check for being a "real organization".
    2. Install the Meta Horizon (formerly "Oculus" and "Meta Quest") app on mobile device (if it isn't already) and login with your (developer) Meta Quest account. Register your headset in the app.
    3. In the Meta Horizon mobile App, tap Menu at the bottom right, then Devices. Select your Quest Pro, then go to `Settings -> Developer Mode` and set the **Developer** Mode switch to enabled.
        * Reboot the headset after enabling Developer Mode.
        * This setting was formerly called "Developer Mode" in software versions before v60, became "Debug Mode" for a few cycles, and is now back again as "Developer Mode"

        width: '100%',

        display: 'block'
    }}>
        <img src={require("./img/dev-mode.png").default} alt="Quest Developer Mode in phone app" />
    </div>

3. Install and start the [Meta Quest Link PC application](https://www.oculus.com/download_app/?id=1582076955407037) (if it isn't already).
4. Follow setup instructions for logging in (with the same developer account created/used earlier to enable dev mode on the headset!) and adding your Quest Pro to `Devices`.
5. In the Meta Quest PC application, click on `Settings` in the left sidebar, then `General` tab. Turn on `Unknown Sources`, and set the `OpenXR Runtime` to `Meta Quest Link`.

:::warning
**SET THE OPENXR RUNTIME TO Meta Quest Link**. Do not forget to do this step!

</div>

6. Navigate to the `Beta` tab. Enable `Developer Runtime Features`, `Eye tracking over Meta Quest Link`, and `Natural Facial Expressions over Meta Quest Link`.
  - Note that `Passthrough over Meta Quest Link` option *may* cause issues and unless you are making or using PCVR apps that use Quest headset passthrough, you should just leave this disabled.
  - Enable Public Test Channel only if you know you want to use some feature/fix in the latest Public Test Channel (*beta*) software. Generally, it is better to **stay off the PTC**. 

:::warning
If you do not see these options, you are not logged into a Meta Quest developer account or you may need to log out then log back in to the Meta Quest Link PC app.

</div>

7. Install either the modules listed in [Modules](#modules) from the VRCFaceTracking module registry.

## Modules

There are a total of **2** different VRCFT modules that will work with Meta Quest Link.
(The links are to Module source repositories, for those interested in contributing and improving the modules.)

1. **[Meta Quest Link module](https://github.com/regzo2/VRCFaceTracking-QuestProOpenXR)**
2. **[ALXR Local module](https://github.com/korejan/VRCFT-ALXR-Modules)**

Both modules are readily available for installation via the VRCFaceTracking built-in module registry.
[Learn how to install modules from the module registry](../../../../vrcft-software/vrcft#installing-the-vrcfacetracking-module).

## Tips and Tricks

<details>
  <summary>Using Index Controllers with the Quest Pro with Link/Airlink</summary>

Download these [Powershell Scripts (VRCFT Discord Link)](https://discord.com/channels/849300336128032789/1033745772979699775/1056009844701806643)

To run, right-click the file -> `"Run with Powershell"`

These scripts will prevent Meta Quest Link from adding the Quest controllers to the SteamVR devices, allowing the use of Index controllers or any other controller of your choosing. 

You may have problems with running Powershell scripts downloaded from the internet (for good reason!). You can learn about [getting around Microsoft's default script security](https://adamtheautomator.com/run-powershell-script/).

## Troubleshooting

### NO MODULES LOADED / Stuck on "Initializing Modules"

Whenever you see this, the cause is because the currently installed module failed to initialize (or you're not even giving enough time for the module to fail attempting to load...).
Switch to the VRCFT Output Log tab and find the relevant error message.

  Try to turn off using integrated GPU through your laptop's BIOS or control center program.

  Alternatively, use Windows Settings to force VRCFaceTracking to "High Performance" (use discrete GPU).
  Open Windows Settings and navigate through System -> Display -> Graphics Settings (a small link under "Multiple Displays" section in Win10, or under "Related Settings" in Win11).

  <summary>[QuestProTrackingModule] Information: Eye Tracking not supported</summary>
  <TroubleShootTable
  cause="Developer mode is not properly enabled.">
  
  On software versions v60, this error seems to be associated with the "Developer Mode" toggle not being enabled for the headset. 
  Use the Meta Horizon mobile app to enable Debug Mode for the Quest Pro headset, then reboot the headset. 
  If the issue persists or the module seems to initialize but doesn't send any data, try logging out then back into your Meta account on both
  the headset (via mobile app) and Meta Quest Link PC application.

### General Problems

<details>
  <summary>[Meta Quest Link/Airlink] I cannot see SteamVR because Link environment is stuck loading some random app</summary>
  <TroubleShootTable
  cause="The nature of the way VRCFaceTracking must pull data from the Oculus OpenXR runtime from the PC is inherently hacky, effectively running 2 VR programs at once.">
    If you started SteamVR first, you can simply switch back to SteamVR in the Oculus Dash.
    You can also try switching up the program startup sequence, starting VRCFaceTracking then SteamVR through the desktop Steam app (not through the Oculus Dash in the headset).
    Yet another solution is to use <Link to="https://github.com/LibreQuest/OculusKiller">OculusKiller</Link> to avoid dealing with the Oculus Dash entirely, though this has its own downsides.

<details>
  <summary>[Meta Quest Link/Airlink] Starting VRCFT forces me out of VRChat and starts a program in SteamVR that never opens</summary>
  <TroubleShootTable
  cause="You have SteamVR set as the OpenXR runtime, which will cause the headless VRCFT module program to open in SteamVR instead of in the Meta Quest Link environment.">
    Set your OpenXR runtime to Meta Quest Link in the Meta Quest Link software.

  <TroubleShootTable
  cause="Meta Moment">
  Try toggling the eye and face tracking enables in the headset settings, and restarting your headset completely. 
  Logging out then back into the account in the PC Oculus application and headset may also help.
  You may also need to re-verify developer account settings if using Oculus Link/Airlink, as well as developer account permissions by logging into the <Link to="https://developer.oculus.com/">Meta Quest Developer Center</Link>.
