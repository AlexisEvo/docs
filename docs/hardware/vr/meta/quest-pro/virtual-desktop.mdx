  <summary>Virtual Desktop Setup</summary>

This following setup assumes that Virtual Desktop has already been purchased from the **Quest Store** in the headset and the Virtual Desktop Streamer PC-side app has been installed on the PC.
Please refer to Virtual Desktop's built-in setup instructions to get started with using Virtual Desktop.

1. [**MAKE SURE YOUR HEADSET HAS EYE AND FACE TRACKING ENABLED**](#enabling-eye-and-face-tracking-on-the-headset)
2. In the Virtual Desktop app *on the headset*, go to the "Streaming" tab, and enable the option `Forward tracking data to PC`. Make sure to click **Yes** to the popup. 
  <!-- <div style={{
    width: '75%',
    height: 'auto',
    margin: 'auto',
    display: 'block'
  }}>
    <img src={require("./img/virtual_desktop_settings.png").default} alt="Virtual Desktop Settings" />
  </div>  -->
3. Start Virtual Desktop Streamer if you have not already and establish headset connection to the PC.
4. Proceed to [Modules](#modules) for compatible modules to use with Virtual Desktop. 
<!-- 4. Install the **Virtual Desktop VRCFT tracking module** -->

:::note
To let the Virtual Desktop VRCFT module properly initialize, make sure to start VRCFT with the Virtual Desktop module installed *after* you start the Virtual Desktop Streamer program on the PC.
