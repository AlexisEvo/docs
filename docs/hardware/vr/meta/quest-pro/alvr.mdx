## Tips and Tricks

<details>
  <summary>Using Index Controllers with the Quest Pro with ALVR</summary>

The customizability of ALVR allows a few options. 
All following mentioned settings can be found in the "Headset" tab of the ALVR server settings.

- Option 1: Completely disable the Quest Pro controllers using the checkbox next to "Controllers"
- Option 2: Set the Controller emulation to "HTC Vive Tracker". This allows real controllers such as the Index Controllers to take precedence in SteamVR, and allow
  for using the Quest Pro controllers for manual playspace calibration.
