# ALXR

[ALXR](https://github.com/korejan/ALVR/wiki/ALXR-Client) is a fork of the open-source ALVR with an emphasis on OpenXR features.
It adopts new OpenXR features and compatible-devices rapidly ("bleeding edge"), which makes it an interesting but not-particularly user-friendly software. 

## Setup

:::note
Using ALXR will require you to [sideload applications to you Quest](./#tips-and-tricks)
:::

1. [**MAKE SURE YOUR HEADSET HAS EYE AND FACE TRACKING ENABLED**](#enabling-eye-and-face-tracking-on-the-headset)
2. Download and install the latest ALXR client *and server* from the [ALXR-nightly](https://github.com/korejan/ALXR-nightly/releases) repository.
If this is your first time using ALXR, follow the [Usage guide](https://github.com/korejan/ALVR/wiki/ALXR-Client#usage) and [Android-specific client install instructions](https://github.com/korejan/ALVR/wiki/ALXR-Client#android-all-flavors---questpicogenericetc)
3. Install the **ALXR Remote** module from the VRCFaceTracking module registry.
4. Open the `ALXRModuleConfig.json` found in the installed module directory.
   - This will either be at `C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\VRCFaceTracking\CustomLibs` or `C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Packages\96ba052f-0948-44d8-86c4-a0212e4ae047_d7rcq4vxghz0r\LocalCache\Roaming\VRCFaceTracking\`
   - [Learn more about the ALXR module configuration options](https://github.com/korejan/VRCFT-ALXR-Modules#module-settings)
5. In `ALXRModuleConfig.json`, in the "RemoteConfig" section set "ClientIpAddress" to the headset IP, this can be found in the ALVR server dashboard.
   - If the client is being run on the same host as the server (e.g. alxr windows client), use localhost IP (default, `127.0.0.1`) and set the server to TCP protocol.
6. Restart VRCFT to reinitialize the ALXR Remote Module with the updated configuration.

## Tips and Tricks

<details>
  <summary>Using Index Controllers with the Quest Pro with ALVR/ALXR</summary>

The customizability of ALVR allows a few options. 
All following mentioned settings can be found in the "Headset" tab of the ALVR server settings.

- Option 1: Completely disable the Quest Pro controllers using the checkbox next to "Controllers"
- Option 2: Set the Controller emulation to "HTC Vive Tracker". This allows real controllers such as the Index Controllers to take precedence in SteamVR, and allow
  for using the Quest Pro controllers for manual playspace calibration.
