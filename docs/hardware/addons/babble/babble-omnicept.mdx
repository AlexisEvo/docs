# Project Babble - HP Reverb G2 Omnicept Setup Guide

## Summary

The [HP Reverb G2 Omnicept Edition](https://www.hp.com/us-en/vr/reverb-g2-vr-headset-omnicept-edition.html) is a VR headset with eye tracking and a lower face camera. While there is a module that allows you to use the headset's eye tracking with VRCFaceTracking, the face camera by itself does not do anything.

***But!*** With Project Babble this camera can be used to track your facial expressions! This guide will show you how to use the lower face camera with VRCFaceTracking.

## Setup

You will need the following software installed to use the lower face camera with VRCFaceTracking:
- The [VRCFaceTracking Babble Module](https://discord.com/channels/974302302179557416/974302302179557419/1165448245502279680)
- [OBS **v27.2.4**](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases/tag/27.2.4)
- [OBS VirtualCam **v2.0.5**](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-virtualcam.949/)
- [Project Babble](https://github.com/SummerSigh/ProjectBabble/releases/latest)
- The [Glia Runtime/SDK](https://developers.hp.com/omnicept/downloads)
- The [Glia Lip Viewer](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/915075185328152606/1122604181728006244/GliaLipViewer.zip)

:::caution
Make sure you use the exact version of OBS and the plugin listed!
:::

### Installation

#### Step 1: Glia Lip Viewer Setup

Firstly, extract the contents of the `GliaLipViewer.zip` file to a folder of your choice. You can delete the zip file after this is done.

<div style={{
    width: '50%',
    height: 'auto',
    margin: 'auto',
    display: 'block'
}}>
    <img src={require("./img/babble_unzipped.png").default} alt="The Glia Lip Viewer, extracted to a folder" />
</div>

Next, run `Glia.exe` inside of this new folder. If your HP Reverb G2 Omnicept Edition is plugged in, you should see a small window with a live feed from the lower face camera, tinted red. Otherwise, you'll see a solid red box. If this is the case make sure your headset is plugged in and that you have the Glia Runtime installed.

:::note
You may get a warning from the Glia Runtime about an application requesting access to the lower face camera. If you do, make sure to click "Allow".
:::

#### Step 2: OBS Setup

Install OBS v27.2.4 as well as the OBS Virtual Camera Plugin. If you have a newer version, you should not have to uninstall it. Open OBS and add a new "Window Capture".

<div style={{
    width: '50%',
    height: 'auto',
    margin: 'auto',
    display: 'block'
}}>
    <img src={require("./img/obs_window_creation.png").default} alt="Creating the OBS Window Capture" />
</div>

Select the Glia window from the list of windows...

<div style={{
    width: '50%',
    height: 'auto',
    margin: 'auto',
    display: 'block'
}}>
    <img src={require("./img/obs_glia_capture.png").default} alt="Selecting the GliaLipViewer window" />
</div>

**Disable** cursor capture. Now resize OBS to fit the size of the window. This can be done by right clicking on the "Window Capture" source and selecting ""Resize output (source size)".

<div style={{
    width: '50%',
    height: 'auto',
    margin: 'auto',
    display: 'block'
}}>
    <img src={require("./img/obs_window_resize.png").default} alt="Resizing the OBS Window" />
</div>

:::note
You may need to change the capture method from "Default" to "Windows XXXX".
:::

Finally, under OBS's **Tools** in the top menu bar select the **VirtualCam** option and click start. Project Babble should detect this as an input device if 1 is entered as input to it!

:::caution
In its present state, you will need to launch the `GliaLipViewer` and OBS's virtual camera every time you want to use this with Project Babble/VRCFaceTracking.
:::

#### (Optional) Step 3: Fine tuning

:::note
This section is intended to fine tune and calibrate project babble, but isn't a necessary step to get it to function
:::

Open the filters tab for the window capture you created...

<div style={{
    width: '50%',
    height: 'auto',
    margin: 'auto',
    display: 'block'
}}>
    <img src={require("./img/obs_window_filter.png").default} alt="OBS Window Capture filter" />
</div>

Add a "Color Correction" filter.

<div style={{
    width: '50%',
    height: 'auto',
    margin: 'auto',
    display: 'block'
}}>
    <img src={require("./img/obs_filter_color_correction.png").default} alt="OBS Window Color Correction" />
</div>

Increase the brightness of the video by adjusting "Gamma", you want to make this about ~3 times as bright as it is by default. You can also adjust the contrast and saturation to your liking.

<div style={{
    width: '50%',
    height: 'auto',
    margin: 'auto',
    display: 'block'
}}>
    <img src={require("./img/obs_filter_gamma.png").default} alt="OBS Window Color Correction Gamma" />
</div>

You should now be able to see your lower facial expressions reflected in VRCFaceTracking! Have fun!
