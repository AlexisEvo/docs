# Project Babble

## Summary

[Project Babble](https://github.com/SummerSigh/ProjectBabble) is an open-source software project aiming to bring accessible face-tracking to PCVR headsets.

:::caution
To clarify, Project Babble provides only lower face tracking, not eye tracking. Now that that's said, read on!
:::

## Set-up

Setting up Project Babble is fairly simple. Please read carefully to avoid any issues. 

:::note
This guide assumes you have Project Babble installed, be it a release or the source code.
It also assumes you have a compatible camera device. A standard webcam will work, but you can also use a phone, etc.
:::

:::info
Fun fact! you can use Project Babble with the HP Reverb G2 Omnicept lower face camera!

### Installation

Start by mounting your camera underneath your headset. The camera should be facing you, and should be able to see your face clearly. There is no "right" way to do this, feel free to experiment with different placements. Plug your camera into your headset's USB port; If you don't have one you can use a USB extension cable or a wireless camera.

Next, install the [latest release](https://github.com/SummerSigh/ProjectBabble/releases/latest) of Project Babble. You may need to define an exception in your antivirus software for this to run optimally. 

Finally, install the VRCFT-Babble module. You can download this from the VRCFaceTracking applications Module Registry Window:

<div style={{
    width: '50%',
    height: 'auto',
    margin: 'auto',
    display: 'block'
}}>
    <img src={require("./img/babble_install.png").default} alt="babble install" />
</div>

## Using The VRCFT-Babble Module

Open the Project Babble application. The application should automatically update itself to the latest version on launch. You should see a window like this:

<div style={{
    width: '50%',
    height: 'auto',
    margin: 'auto',
    display: 'block'
}}>
    <img src={require("./img/babble_startup.png").default} alt="babble startup" />
</div>

After clicking start, VRFaceTracking should start to listen to incoming face data. It will relay this information into VRChat.

### Calibrating Face Tracking

Project Babble offers a calibration tool to help you get the best face tracking possible. To use it, click the "Calibrate" button and follow the instructions on screen. You will be asked to crop out a section of the camera feed.

In addition to face tracking calibration, you can also specify Project Babble to use your GPU using DirectML. There are some other settings as well, be sure to experiment with them to find what works best for you.
